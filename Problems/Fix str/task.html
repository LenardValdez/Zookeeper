  <p>The previous developer accidentally named a variable <code class="java">str</code>. Since this name is reserved for a built-in type,&nbsp;now the code fails.</p> 
  <p>Please fix the variable by adding <code class="java">_</code>&nbsp;to the end of this name as it's said in the code style guide.</p> 
  <p>Your output should look like <code class="java">Hello10</code>&nbsp;and you don't need to print anything.</p>
